# Natural-Language-Processing-Sentence-Classification
Constructed feed forward neural networks for sentence classification
In this project, we used neural network models to classify sentences into respective categories. We used word embeddings to prepare the sentences to be fed into the neural network models. We designed and trained a feed forward neural network model, a long short term memory model and transformer to classify the sentences. 
In this repository, the codes for the feedforward neural network and long short term memory models are provided. A powerpoint presentation is also available which contains the findings and parameters used in the model.
